# Street Game
This is my first game. It's a 2D game where you create roads and bridges so 
cars can get across the map.

## Todos
### Must-haves
- Map with islands and landmarks and two road endpoints
- Editor to create roads and bridges
    - Roads can only be created on land
    - Bridges can only be created over water
      - Every other bridge tile gets a "column tile" below it
- "Run" button to start simulation
  - Cars are auto-generated and show up on the map. They attempt to make it across
    the map
  - Game is successfully completed when cars can make it from one endpoint to the
    other

### Nice-to-haves
- Allow user to create islands
